# Node wireless firmware
Firmware for the onw designed wireless node. The node is based on the ESP32c3 uC. The firmware is written in C and uses esp-idf libraries.

## ! Deprecated !
The firmware will not be developed further in this repo for ESM32c3. After testing, it turned out that the system is inefficient in terms of power consumption. The ESP32c3 is not suitable for low power applications. The firmware will be developed further in different repo for NRF52833 chip.
